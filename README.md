Project Name: Patient Record Management System (AVL Tree Based)Overview:This project is a Python-based application designed to manage patient records using an AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree) data structure. The system ensures efficient data retrieval and modification while maintaining a balanced tree structure. It also features a custom persistent storage system that saves the state of records to disk with timestamped filenames, allowing for data integrity checks and version rollback.Key Features:AVL Tree Data Structure:Implements a self-balancing binary search tree to store patient data.Ensures $O(\log n)$ time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.Patient Attributes: Each node stores a Patient ID, Name, Is Cured (Boolean), and a list of Diseases.CRUD Operations:Add: Insert new patient records.Update: Modify existing details (Name, Cured status, Diseases) for a patient.Remove: Delete patient records from the system.Search: Find patient details using their unique Patient ID.Persistent Storage & Versioning:File-Based Storage: Transactions are saved as individual files in a storage/ directory. Each file is named with a timestamp (e.g., 02-10-2025 09-24-01).Rollback Capability: The system allows users to "roll back" to a previous version of the database. It verifies the hash chains of all intermediate files to ensure the rollback is safe and valid.Data Integrity & Security:Hashing: Uses SHA-256 to hash the tree state. This hash is stored in the file to detect if data has been tampered with manually.Read-Only Files: On supported platforms (like Windows), storage files are set to "Read Only" to prevent accidental modification.
